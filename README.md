Hamster Climb is a hard but reasonably fair game. Climb through the platforming levels as a hamster. Just try not to fall all the way back down. Fight various wacky bosses and try to have fun.

This is a remaster and retexture of my previous game.

You play as a hamster in this one so it's automatically better.
